# Text_Similarity_-_Movies

We want to explore the similarities of movies regarding their plot and subtitles.
We get data from srt files (subtitles) and web scraping the movie'splot section in wikipedia.
After some data cleaning we plot a heatmap of the cosine similarity of the movies regarding of their plots and then of their subtitles.
